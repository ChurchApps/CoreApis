## Usage Examples

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to specific environment
gh workflow run deploy-staging.yml

# Deploy to production with confirmation
gh workflow run deploy-prod.yml -f confirm_production="DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION"
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Initialize databases in staging
gh workflow run database-migration.yml -f environment=staging -f migration_type=init

# Reset demo databases
gh workflow run database-migration.yml -f environment=demo -f migration_type=reset

# Migrate specific module
gh workflow run database-migration.yml -f environment=staging -f migration_type=specific-module -f module=membership
```

### Health Checks
```bash
# Check all environments
gh workflow run health-check.yml

# Check specific environment
gh workflow run health-check.yml -f environment=prod
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Slack Notifications
- Deployment status (success/failure)
- Health check alerts
- Database operation notifications
- Security scan results

### Monitoring Endpoints
- **Demo**: https://api-demo.churchapps.org/health
- **Staging**: https://api-staging.churchapps.org/health  
- **Production**: https://api.churchapps.org/health

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   - Create feature branch
   - Open pull request
   - CI workflow runs automatically
   - Merge after review and tests pass

2. **Staging Deployment**
   - Push to main branch
   - Automatic deployment to staging
   - Integration tests run
   - Manual testing and validation

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Create GitHub release
   - Production deployment workflow triggers
   - Smoke tests and health checks
   - Monitor for issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Deployment Failures
1. Check AWS credentials and permissions
2. Verify serverless.yml configuration  
3. Review CloudWatch logs
4. Check database connectivity

#### Test Failures
1. Verify database setup in CI
2. Check environment variable configuration
3. Review test database connectivity
4. Validate test data initialization

#### Health Check Failures
1. Check API endpoint availability
2. Verify database connections
3. Review Lambda function logs
4. Check security group configurations

### Support
- Review workflow logs in GitHub Actions tab
- Check CloudWatch logs for Lambda errors
- Monitor Slack channels for automated alerts
- Contact DevOps team for infrastructure issues

## Best Practices

1. **Always test in staging first** before production deployment
2. **Use manual confirmation** for production deployments
3. **Monitor health checks** after deployments
4. **Keep dependencies updated** via automated PRs
5. **Review security scan results** regularly
6. **Use environment-specific configurations** 
7. **Test database migrations** in non-production first
